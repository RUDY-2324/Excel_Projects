Sales Data Analysis 
1. Project Overview
This project aims to analyse sales data to identify key trends, customer preferences, and factors influencing revenue generation. By leveraging Excel tools such as pivot tables, pivot charts, and conditional formatting, a comprehensive analysis was performed on various dimensions like monthly sales performance, customer demographics, regional contributions, and sales channels.
The primary objective was to derive actionable insights to improve decision-making for Vrinda Store, a retail business. The analysis focuses on identifying the highest-selling categories, gender-based purchase behaviour, age-wise buying trends, and the most effective sales channels.
